                This project involved the design and construction of a system to help people who are busy to do grocery shopping very fast and easy. The primary aim of the task was to collect data to see how users will do grocery shopping. Initially, team members brainstormed who our target users were and created an interview protocol of questions to follow. Following the development of the interview protocol, each member of the team interviewed three separate users’ who matched our target user. After interviewing, as a team we created an affinity diagram to find our discoveries. The significant themes that we found in our finding was that most of the users had a list of what to purchase and checked the price of each item based on their memory, which they bought last time. This report will outline the research question and goal, result of our data, and personas that represent our user archetypes.    </div>
